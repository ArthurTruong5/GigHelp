# GigHelp ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

GigHelp is a community gig marketplace which provides people to outsource everyday work. Users are able to choose a task and people in the community can bid for the task.

## Installation

To install

`$ git clone https://github.com/ArthurTruong5/GigHelp.git`

`$ cd GigHelp`

`$ bundle install`

`$ rake db:migrate`

### Requirements

*  Ruby 2.2.4
* Rails 5.2.0



## Process


Before developing GiGhelp, I thought through questions such as:

* How can we entice people to join GigHelp?

* What makes us different than Airtasker?


* How can we make it more community based?

* How can we incorporate payment systems that we've been learning?

## Technology Stack

* HTML/CSS
* Ruby on Rails

## Homepage design

Designing the homepage was a challenging process. One of the requirements was to add a search functionality and I wanted a way users could find task by title. This would simplify the process of what users needed. e.g cleaning would show every title that has "cleaning" keyword and is filtered through pg_search gem.

Once I selected the overall layout, I selected the color scheme. The idea was to pick a color that would build around trust and community and using blue as the main color scheme. According to whycolourmatters.com, "most blues convey a sense of trust, loyalty, cleanliness, and understanding." My second color choice was using a light green to symbolise nature that can represent most of my buttons and highlights.

## Task

A user can create a task and is asked certain required questions. The user will then be redirected to a address page. The geolocator gem is able to scout out other nearby task and will output metres on a 20km radius.

```ruby
<% for location in @location.nearbys(20) %>
<li><%= link_to location.address, task_location_path %> (<%= location.distance.round(2) %> miles) (<%= @task.title %>)</li>
<% end %>
```

## Images/Multimedia

I used https://www.pexels.com/ for free copyright images and picked certain images that would fit my color scheme.

## Views/Locations/Bids

Users are able to see the information about the task. The user who creates the task can also accept offers. Note that only the user that CREATES the task can see the accept button offer. The user will be proceeded to the next window for payment. Payment will be then sent out to the bid user once task is confirmed finished.
